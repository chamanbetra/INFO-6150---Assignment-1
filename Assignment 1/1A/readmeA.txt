This Website is a coffee shop website,
I developed two HTML pages.
I used the image tag and applied CSS to format the landing page
I have created style1.css for styling purpose


1. I have used the favicon and svg tags for icon
2. Title Element <title> that displays a title for the page in search engine-results for all the pages i have created.
3. <link> tag is used to link to external style sheets:
4. From the index i.e,(home page) Click on our locations to go the page1.html page for that i have used <a> tag to defines a hyperlink
5. On the Home Page I have added a button called our locations to go to the maps and video page.
6. The <button> element for submitting a form to navigate between pages
7. Additionally, I have added table to display the menu in the second page.
8. Also added icons for facebook, twitter and instagram to lead to the respective social page.
